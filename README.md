# Multiple_Word_template_generator_pysimpleGUI

This is a very simple Word template generator for automating manually filling word templates.

It takes data values manually populated in excel and generates template in bulk based on the number of rows in the excel.

It is important to name your word template and data file as they are in the code or change that in the code.

You can create any template by adding {{TEXT}} in the word file but you also need to have the same column name set in the excel like TEXT.

The code can be exported via psgcompiler and made into a .exe for external users.

I have created a instructions button that can be populated with an f string so you can give instructions to users on how to use the tool and/or modify the template criteria.
